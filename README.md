# API

API requests for my SDN class are stored in this repos.

The first additon is using the Python requests module (request formatted into a script .py).  References I used for compiling this are Cisco DEVASC 200-901 and Postman.

---Added APIjoke.py, it is the same as PythonReq, just different name.---
